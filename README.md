# Human-Action-Classifier
Final Project for the course Intro to Deep Learning
The goal is to classify the image sequences in the dataset UCF11 into 11 different categories. The sequences were preprocessed and serialized with python pickle module.
Three CNN models were designed and implemented and a final model which consists of a CNN and a LSTM unit was chosen to be trained.
Implemented with TensorFlow, GPU enabled.
